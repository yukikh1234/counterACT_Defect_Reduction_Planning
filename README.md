# CounterACT: Counterfactual ACTion Rule Mining Approach

## Experiment reproduction

To reproduce the experiments and obtain the results presented in our study, please follow these steps:

1. **Run experiment script**: Execute the `runexp.py` script, this process will generate and store all the resulting data in the `results` directory in CSV format.

2. **Research Questions (RQs) analysis**: For each research question, run the respective `rq1.py`, `rq2.py`, or `rq3.py` script. These scripts will compute and present the results for each RQ.

3. **Precision and Recall calculation**: Use the `precision_recall.py` script to calculate precision and recall metrics at both the release and commit levels. Set the parameter `commit=True` for commit level calculations.

## Results directory

Sample results for all three RQs are available in the `results` directory for reference and validation of the experiment outcomes.
