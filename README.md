# CounterACT: Counterfactual ACTion Rule Mining Approach

## Experiment reproduction

To reproduce the experiments and obtain the results presented in our study, please follow these steps:

1. **Run experiment script**: Execute the `runexp.py` script. This process will generate and store all the resulting data in the `results` directory in CSV format. The results of RQ1 will be exported to a file named `rules`.

2. **Research Questions (RQs) analysis**: For research question analysis, run the respective `rq2.py` or `rq3.py` script. These scripts will compute and present the results for each RQ.

3. **Precision and Recall calculation**: Use the `Rq2_precision_recall.py` script to read the results from the `results` directory and compute precision and recall metrics at both the release and commit levels.

## Results directory
Sample results for RQ2 and RQ3 are available in the `results` directory for reference and validation of the experiment outcomes.
